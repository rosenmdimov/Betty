Betty Slot Game Automation Framework (Spinberry - Irish Wilds)

This framework is built using C#, Reqnroll (Cucumber for .NET), NUnit,
and Playwright (.NET), and follows a clean DI (Dependency Injection) architecture.
It is designed to be easily scalable and supports execution across different profiles
(Desktop and Mobile Emulation) via configuration in appsettings.json.

# Prerequisites

1. .NET 8.0 SDK or newer.

2. Visual Studio (or VS Code).

3. Playwright Browsers: Playwright binary files must be installed.

4. Install the extension Reqnroll for Visual Studio 22

# Installation and Setup

1. Clone or unzip the project.

2. Restore dependencies: Open a command prompt in the project's root directory and run:dotnet restore
3. Install Playwright Browsers: Playwright requires binary files for Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit.pwsh bin/Debug/net8.0/playwright.ps1 install
4. Configure `appsettings.json`:
    - Ensure the `appsettings.json` file is correctly configured with the required profiles and settings.

# Running the Tests

Tests are executed using profiles defined in `appsettings.json`. You can switch between profiles using the `TEST_PROFILE` environment variable.

1. Running in Desktop Profile (Default)
    - If `TEST_PROFILE` is not set, `desktopChrome` is used.dotnet test
2. Running in Mobile Profile (Emulation)
    - Use `TEST_PROFILE=mobileWebkit` for iPhone 12 emulation.

   **PowerShell (Windows):**


	$env:TEST_PROFILE="mobileWebkit" dotnet test

   **Bash/Zsh (Linux/macOS):** 

	TEST_PROFILE=mobileWebkit dotnet test

3. Viewing Test Results:
    - Test results are logged in HTML format and can be found at: ```
      [ProjectDir]\bin\Debug\net8.0\reports\TestResults.html3. Paralel execution#
    - The parameters that take care of the parallel execution of the tests are found in:
      /Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs

   ## Static parameters

*[assembly: Parallelizable(ParallelScope.All)] - Sets the maximum number of threads that NUnit should use.
0 means NUnit should use as many CPU cores as are available (recommended).*
*[assembly: LevelOfParallelism(4)]   Using this parameter here, we can set the number of
threads/workers statically by running the tests from
the terminal with the command: dotnet test*

## Dynamic parameters


	cmd /c "set TEST_PROFILE=mobileWebkit && dotnet test -- NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers=3"


*the command above will start the tests on mobileWebkit device(iPhone 12) on 3 TestWorkers*

Reporting Test Results
ðŸ“¸ Automatic Screenshots on Failure
When a test fails, the system automatically takes a full-page screenshot and saves it in:
[ProjectDir]\bin\Debug\net8.0\reports\screenshots

ðŸ“„ Generating a Detailed Report
Execution results are logged in HTML format. To generate a nice HTML report.

Path to the NUnit XML file:
[ProjectDir]\bin\Debug\net8.0\reports\TestResults.xml

# Architectural Overview

- **BDD/Test Runner:** Reqnroll (using NUnit as the executor) provides the BDD structure (Gherkin) and manages the scenario lifecycle.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Reqnroll (BoDi Container) automatically injects all core objects (IPage, AppConfig, IrishWildsPage) into class constructors.
- **Profiles:** `DIHooks.cs` loads a configuration profile (desktop/mobile) from `appsettings.json`.
- **Mobile Emulation:** `BrowserManager.cs` applies device options when creating the `IBrowserContext`, ensuring tests run in a mobile environment.
- **Gameplay Validation:** `IrishWildsPage.cs` encapsulates the logic for spinning, fetching the balance, and validating that the balance is updated after a series of spins.
- **Shared State:** `ScenarioState` is used to manage shared state between steps, such as the initial balance.
